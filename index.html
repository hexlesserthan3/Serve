        <p>The rain slapped against the window like a debt collector at my door—unrelenting, cold, and full of bad intentions. I sat at my kitchen table, dentures clicking in anticipation, staring down the abyss of an empty mixing bowl. The world outside was chaos. The world inside? About to be drowned in cheese and water.</p>

<p>I learned this recipe from my Mee-Maw, back when times were simpler, and you could trust a handshake. She had hands like tree roots and a glare that could curdle fresh milk. “You want real pasta?” she’d say, squinting into the distance like a war-hardened general. “Then you gotta be ready to fight for it.”</p>

<p>I took a deep breath. The battle began.</p>

<p>First, the onion. Chopped, quartered. A tear ran down my cheek—not from emotion, but from the sting of the onion’s unyielding spirit. It hit the bowl with a thud. The cheese was next. No, wait. Abort. Abort. Not yet. Just the water. This wasn’t my first rodeo, but even seasoned warriors make mistakes.</p>

<p>Spinach rained down like green confetti at a soldier’s homecoming. The cheese returned, this time for real. More water. My hands trembled, but I pressed on. There was no turning back. The tomatoes fell into formation, their red bodies floating in the murky battlefield of liquid gold. Then came the mushrooms—silent, deadly, bringing the earthiness of the trenches into my kitchen.</p>

<p>I felt my pulse quicken. The air was thick with tension and the scent of dairy-based devastation. I added more cheese. Then water. Then cheese. Then water. The cycle was endless. Relentless. Like time itself.</p>

<p>Garlic. I had to make a choice—minced or chopped. I went with minced. It was weaker, yes, but I needed speed. The enemy was closing in. The pot bubbled, its anger rising. It wanted pasta. It wanted more.</p>

<p>Shredded mint leaves fluttered into the mix, followed by olive oil—because sometimes, even war needs a little luxury. And then, at last, the pasta. The lifeblood of civilization. I watched it disappear into the bubbling, cheesy abyss.</p>

<p>And then... silence. The storm had passed. The battlefield lay still, the war over. I poured the final, liquified remains into the baking dish and sealed it away in the cold, unfeeling prison of the refrigerator. An hour would pass before I could taste my victory.</p>

<p>This wasn’t just pasta. This was survival. This was legacy.</p>

<p>And when I took my first bite, Mee-Maw’s voice whispered through time:
"You fought well, kid. Now eat."</p>

            <ul>
                <li>58 g pasta</li>
                <li>37 ml olive oil</li>
                <li>8 g shredded mint leaves</li>
                <li>90 g minced garlic</li>
                <li>2 g cheese</li>
                <li>53 g sliced cremini mushrooms</li>
                <li>26 kg tomatoes</li>
                <li>3 l water</li>
                <li>50 g fresh spinach</li>
                <li>20 g chopped and quartered yellow onion</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Cooking Time ^^</h2>
            <ol>
                <p>My pasta method is a little unusual. This is the way my mee-maw taught it to me and this is the way I’ve always done it; so now I’m here to share the joy. You start with a chopped and quartered yellow onion in the first mixing bowl. Combine both cheese and water in the mixing bowl- wait. Scratch that, no cheese; just add water to the first mixing bowl. Some fresh spinach into the mixing bowl and then add both cheese and water to the first one.</p>

 <p>Now, at this point, the whole mixture should be pretty watery. So, combine some cheese into the mixing bowl and put some tomatoes in there too. More cheese never hurt - combine some more into the bowl and put in some sliced cremini mushrooms too. Ain’t that just delightful? But we’re missing just a tiny bit of that sweet sweet cheesy water - so combine some cheese and add some water. </p>

 <p>Minced garlic is not as flavourful as chopped but it’s easy to use, so put some of that in a bowl and add some cheese and water. Put some shredded mint leaves in the bowl and combine with some cheese and water. Some olive oil to wet the bowl, then combine with water and put some pasta in there. You’re almost done :D</p>

 <p>Combine the last bit of your cheese and make sure everything is nice and liquified and pour your mixture from the mixing bowl to a baking dish. Refrigerate it for just an hour before serving it. Remember, it only serves one!
