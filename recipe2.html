        <p>The kitchen was quiet, save for the rhythmic ticking of the old wall clock and the distant hum of the world beyond my window. I stood at the counter, tracing the rim of the mixing bowl with my fingertips, as if it could whisper back memories. </p> 

<p>"Quiche, huh?" I murmured to no one but the ghosts of my past. "I haven’t made that since 1973."</p>

<p>The year I met him. The year I learned that love could taste like butter and eggs, delicate and rich, warm as a hand on your cheek. The year he first sat at my kitchen table, smiling that lopsided grin, telling me—between mouthfuls—that he’d never had a quiche like mine before.  </p>

<p>I swallowed the lump in my throat and got to work. </p> 

<p>Milk, smooth as silk, poured into the bowl, followed by eggs. I cracked them carefully, watching the yolks swirl, golden like autumn sunsets. Pepper drifted in, dark specks against pale clouds, a reminder that love—real love—had a little bite to it.  </p>

<p>I could almost hear him laughing. "Fresh parsley, sweetheart. Because fresh is best." I smiled despite myself and reached for the knife, chopping with practiced precision.</p>  

<p>The crust lay waiting, empty. I let the ingredients flow into it, filling the void. Salt and parsley danced together, settling into the embrace of the eggs and milk. It was so simple. It had always been so simple. Just like us. </p> 

<p>But life doesn’t always stay simple.  </p>

<p>The second quiche was different. More complicated. Layers of flavor, layers of history. Sauteed asparagus, tender and green, like the fields we once walked through. Mushrooms, earthy and deep, the scent of rainy mornings spent curled up with old books.  </p>

<p>Caramelized onions—sweet, slow, patient, like the years that had softened us. Bacon and ham, hearty and strong, as he had been, even in the end. Goat’s cheese, the final note, sharp yet comforting. It melted into the mixture, binding everything together, just as time had bound us. </p> 

<p>I poured it all into the baking dish and let it rest. An hour in the cold, like love set aside but never forgotten.</p>  

<p>As I cleaned my mixing bowls, I imagined setting a single plate at the table, steam curling from a golden, flaky quiche.  </p>

<p>I would take my first bite, eyes closed, tasting memories.  </p>

<p>And somewhere, somehow, he’d be smiling that lopsided grin again, saying, "Still never had a quiche like yours, sweetheart."</p>

            <h2>Ingredients for Ham and Bacon Quiche</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>95 g goat cheese</li>
                <li>99 g cooked cubed ham</li>

            <h2>Cooking Time ^^</h2>

                <p>Alright, let me think. Quiche huh? I haven’t made that since 1973 and my husband really likes it. Well, liked. He ain’t around no more. Oh well, put some milk into the bowl and eggs and pepper. Put all of that into the pie crust in the bowl and put in some salt and chopped fresh parsley. Remember, it has to be fresh, because fresh is best. </p>

<p>That’s quite literally it. Your perfect golden brown quiche will be ready. All you have to do is liquify the ingredients and pour the contents into the baking dish. You could also serve it with another entirely different recipe. </p>

<p>Remember to clean your mixing bowls, dearies. In this one, you have to take your sauteed chopped asparagus and your sauteed mushrooms. Some caramelized onions will bring out the best in your dish, along with bacon and cooked cubed ham; put those in too. Some goat’s cheese to round it off and then pour it all from the mixing bowl into a baking dish. Refrigerate for an hour.</p>

<p>Serve to one person, too many consumers will ruin the portions. </p>
