        <p>Now, I know what you’re thinking. Sangria? Without alcohol? What kind of cruel joke is this? But listen here, sugarplum, I’ve been through a lot in my seventy-odd years, and I’ll tell you right now—there’s a reason this drink stays dry as a preacher’s Sunday suit.</p>

<p>It all started with Ernest.</p>

<p>Ernest was a man of principle. A man of discipline. A man who, after one ill-advised sip of champagne at our wedding, sneezed so hard he knocked over the entire cake. I spent the first ten minutes of our marriage scraping buttercream off his mother’s mink stole while she glared at me like I’d personally pushed him into the frosting. That was the first—and last—time alcohol ever crossed his lips.</p>

<p>So when it came to sangria, we made do without.</p>

<p>First, we start simple. Sparkling water, lemon juice, star anise, cubed blood orange, and sliced apple—all into the first mixing bowl. This part is easy. This part is where you feel like you have your life together.</p>

<p>But then—the soda settles.</p>

<p>That’s when you realize, with great horror, that carbonation is a fickle mistress. So now you have to shake your plain soda until it’s carbonated again. Can you do it by hand? Yes. Should you? No, unless you want to look like you're summoning spirits. So use a carbonator, unless you're in the mood for a workout.</p>

<p>Next, non-alcoholic white wine goes into the bowl. And before you even ask—yes, non-alcoholic. Because the last time I even considered making real sangria, Ernest got so scandalized he called our pastor to “check in” on my spiritual well-being.</p>

<p>Now, crush your ice. Grind it like your ex-husband’s new wife grinds her teeth when she sees you thriving. Mix that ice with apple cider and sugar until it’s just the right amount of frosty chaos. Stir for four minutes—not three, not five, exactly four. Any less and the sugar doesn’t dissolve. Any more and you start questioning your life choices.</p>

<p>Lemon slices and agave nectar get tossed in next. The agave nectar is important, because it makes you feel fancy even though you bought it on clearance.</p>

<p>And now—the secret. Pickled mint. You don’t just throw mint in and call it a day like some amateur. No, no. You pickle it. Stir that bowl for 20 minutes. (Yes, you read that right.) You will feel foolish. You will feel like you are summoning an eldritch entity. But you will persevere.</p>

<p>Once the liquid is fully liquefied (as liquids should be), pour the contents into a baking dish. Why a baking dish? I don’t know, darling. That’s just how we do things here. Refrigerate for an hour, serve it up, and prepare for greatness.</p>

<p>Is it non-alcoholic? Yes.
Does it taste just as good? Also yes.
Does it prevent your husband from reenacting the Great Wedding Cake Disaster of ’59? Absolutely.</p>

<p>And that, my dears, is why we keep it that way.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>19 ml apple cider</li>
                <li>5 g sugar</li>
                <li>2 ml ice</li>
                <li>116 ml non alcoholic white wine</li>
                <li> 3 ml plain soda </li>
                <li>9 g sliced apple</li>
                <li>51 g cubed blood orange</li>
                <li>95 g cinnamon sticks</li>
                <li>98 g star anise</li>
                <li>114 ml lemon juice</li>
                <li>111 ml sparkling water</li>
                <li>2 g mint</li>
                <li>84 ml agave nectar</li>
                <li>104 g lemon slices</li>
                <li>114 ml lemon juice</li>
                <li>114 ml lemon juice</li>
            </ul>

                <p>A drink huh? Ain’t that just fine and dandy. This is non alcoholic though, since neither me nor Ernest ever drank. Sparkling water, lemon juice, star anise and cubed blood orange and sliced apple into the first mixing bowl. </p>

<p>Now at this point, your soda will have settled so you have to carbonate your plain soda. Combine ice in the first mixing bowl and shake the plain soda until carbonated. You could do it by hand but you should probably get a carbonator. Non alcoholic white wine goes into the bowl with ice. </p>

<p>Remember: you must crush the ice. Before that, put apple cider and combine it with sugar in the first mixing bowl. You should grind the ice until crushed and stir the mixing bowl for 4 minutes. Put some lemon slices and agave nectar into that mixing bowl.</p>

<p>The secret to the perfect drink is pickling the mint. Stir the first mixing bowl for 20 minutes and garnish the mint until pickled. Remember: the liquid must be liquefied and pour the contents of the mixing bowl into the baking dish. Refrigerate for an hour and serve to the lucky person.</p>
