        <p>Well, well, well. Look who’s stumbled into my little corner of the internet. Welcome, sugar! Pull up a chair, grab a mixing bowl, and let’s get to know each other.</p>

<p>My name? Oh, just call me Grandma May. I’m seventy, I’ve got a mean set of dentures, and I’ve been cooking since before you were even a twinkle in the universe’s eye. Some people knit, some people garden—I make food so good it could bring a grown man to tears.</p>

<p>I started this blog for one simple reason: I have far too many recipes and not nearly enough people to feed. My late husband, Ernest, bless his stubborn soul, was my #1 taste tester (even when he didn’t want to be). But since he’s off causing trouble in the afterlife, I figured I’d share my kitchen wisdom with you lovely folks instead.</p>

<p>Now, let’s set some ground rules:</p>
<ol>
    <li>I don’t believe in bland food. If you’re the type to measure garlic with your heart, we’ll get along just fine.</li>

    <li>I refuse to use fancy gadgets. If I can’t make it with a wooden spoon and a questionable amount of butter, I don’t want it.</li>

    <li>Alcohol? Not in my house. We don’t need it. Life is chaotic enough without Ernest toppling over the furniture after a single sip of sherry.</li>
</ol>
<p>This blog isn’t just about cooking—it’s about stories. Every recipe has a history, a little bit of love, and probably some mild kitchen-related trauma (I will never forget the Great Chicken Fire of ‘88).</p>

<p>I'm sorry if the blog looks weird; that's just what happens when you're seventy and decide you want to pick up a new skill. So whether you’re here to learn, laugh, or just kill time while your own baking dish chills in the fridge, you’re always welcome in my kitchen. Just remember to clean your mixing bowls, dearies.</p>

<p>Now, let’s get to cooking!</p>
